    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The term meta means a human being with superpowers.
      <br>There are studies in the comics as to whether or not this is a genetic condition, as powers can manifest at birth and/or
      later on.
      <br>Meta-humans, commonly shortened as metas, and often referred to as superhumans, are individuals who acquired powers
      and abilities unlike those of normal humans after experiencing mutation of their bodies (in comparison to magic users,
      who learned how to harness primordial energies without being mutated themselves).
      <br>Most obtained their powers after surviving an explosion caused by a malfunction of the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator
      on December 11th, 2013.
      <br>These people were exposed to the particles and dark matter that altered their genetic, chemical, or even atomic structure,
      giving them a variety of abilities.
      <br>Their abilities seem to often relate to what energy or matter the future superhumans were directly in contact with
      at the time of exposure. </h5>

        <h1>History</h1>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">The earliest meta-humans date back to the times of Ancient India, with Savitar being the first speedster, and the
          mightiest of them all in the multiverse. It's unknown whether there are Savitars of alternate universes.To prepare
          worlds for his arrival, Savitar would interact with the humans through his avatar as Alchemy, possessing them to
          do his being and create cults in his name. Savitar's source of powers was the Brahmastra, commonly known as the
          Philosopher's Stone, an ancient Indian artifact able to mutate people into meta-humans. Savitar used this artifact
          on himself, tying it to his destiny forever, resulting in him depending on the Brahmastra to lure new candidates
          to be his "Alchemy", whom would free him from the prison in the Speed Force along with the Philosopher's Stone.
